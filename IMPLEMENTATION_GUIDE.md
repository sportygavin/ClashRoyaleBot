# Clash Royale Bot - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Complete Implementation Plan

You now have a fully functional Clash Royale bot framework! Here's your step-by-step implementation roadmap:

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (Day 1-2)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/gsheppard/ClashRoyaleBot
python setup.py
```

### 2. Set Up Android Emulator
- Download and install **MEmu** (recommended) or **BlueStacks**
- Create a new Android instance
- Install Clash Royale from Google Play Store
- Configure emulator settings:
  - Resolution: 1920x1080 (or update config.py)
  - Performance: High
  - Root: Enabled (for advanced features)

### 3. Test Basic Setup
```bash
python tests/test_bot.py
```

## Phase 2: Computer Vision Enhancement (Day 3-5)

### Current Implementation
The bot currently has placeholder computer vision. You need to enhance it:

### 1. Card Recognition
```python
# In src/vision/game_vision.py
def _extract_player_cards(self, screen: np.ndarray) -> List[Card]:
    # Replace placeholder with actual card detection
    # Use template matching or deep learning
    pass
```

**Implementation Options:**
- **Template Matching**: Create templates for each card
- **Deep Learning**: Train a CNN to recognize cards
- **OCR**: Use Tesseract for card names

### 2. Elixir Detection
```python
def _extract_elixir(self, gray_screen: np.ndarray) -> float:
    # Implement actual elixir bar detection
    # Look for elixir droplets or bar fill level
    pass
```

### 3. Game State Detection
Enhance the detection methods with actual image processing:
- Use OpenCV template matching
- Implement color-based detection
- Add edge detection for UI elements

## Phase 3: Strategy Development (Day 6-8)

### 1. Basic Strategy Enhancement
The current strategy is very basic. Enhance it:

```python
# In src/strategy/basic_strategy.py
def _analyze_and_decide(self, game_info: GameInfo) -> Optional[Dict]:
    # Add more sophisticated decision making:
    # - Card synergies
    # - Opponent troop analysis
    # - Elixir advantage/disadvantage
    # - Tower targeting
    pass
```

### 2. Advanced Strategies
Implement multiple strategy modes:
- **Aggressive**: Fast push strategies
- **Defensive**: Counter-attack strategies  
- **Control**: Elixir management strategies
- **Cycle**: Cheap card cycling

### 3. Deck-Specific Strategies
Create strategies for different deck archetypes:
- Beatdown decks
- Control decks
- Cycle decks
- Siege decks

## Phase 4: Machine Learning Training (Day 9-12)

### 1. Data Collection
Run the bot for several hours to collect match data:
```bash
python main.py
# Let it play 50-100 matches
```

### 2. Feature Engineering
Enhance the feature extraction:
```python
# In src/learning/ml_system.py
def state_to_features(self, game_info: GameInfo) -> np.ndarray:
    # Add more sophisticated features:
    # - Troop positions
    # - Card cycle state
    # - Elixir advantage
    # - Tower health ratios
    pass
```

### 3. Model Training
Implement advanced ML techniques:
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Current implementation
- **Double DQN**: Improved stability
- **Dueling DQN**: Separate value/advantage estimation
- **Policy Gradient**: Direct policy optimization

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize ML parameters:
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Network architecture
- Experience replay buffer size

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Day 13-15)

### 1. Opponent Analysis
```python
class OpponentAnalyzer:
    def analyze_opponent_deck(self, game_info: GameInfo):
        # Detect opponent's deck composition
        pass
    
    def predict_opponent_strategy(self, game_info: GameInfo):
        # Predict opponent's next moves
        pass
```

### 2. Real-Time Adaptation
```python
class AdaptiveStrategy:
    def adapt_to_opponent(self, match_history: List[Dict]):
        # Adjust strategy based on opponent behavior
        pass
```

### 3. Advanced Automation
- Multi-card combinations
- Precise timing
- Advanced positioning
- Spell usage optimization

## Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Day 16-18)

### 1. Performance Testing
- Win rate analysis
- Reaction time optimization
- Detection accuracy testing
- Memory usage optimization

### 2. Anti-Detection Measures
- Human-like delays
- Randomized actions
- Natural movement patterns
- Variable reaction times

### 3. Safety Features
- Account protection
- Automatic pausing
- Error recovery
- Logging and monitoring

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Run the Bot
```bash
python main.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python tests/test_bot.py
```

### Setup Environment
```bash
python setup.py
```

### View Match Data
```bash
ls data/matches/
cat data/matches/match_*.json
```

## üìä Monitoring Progress

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Win Rate**: Target 60%+ against real players
2. **Detection Accuracy**: Card/elixir detection precision
3. **Reaction Time**: Average decision time
4. **Learning Progress**: ML model improvement
5. **Match Duration**: Average game length

### Logging
Check logs in:
- `logs/` directory
- Console output
- Match data in `data/matches/`

## üîß Configuration Tips

### For Better Performance
```python
# In config.py
BOT_CONFIG = {
    "reaction_time_ms": 150,  # Slower = more human-like
    "max_thinking_time_ms": 1000,  # Faster = more responsive
    "enable_learning": True,
}
```

### For Better Detection
```python
GAME_CONFIG = {
    "screen_resolution": (1920, 1080),  # Match your emulator
    "game_area": {
        "x": 0, "y": 0,  # Adjust for your setup
        "width": 1920, "height": 1080
    }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Legal & Ethical
- **Terms of Service**: Review Clash Royale's ToS
- **Account Safety**: Use test accounts only
